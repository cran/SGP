  o Fixed studentGrowthPercentiles function to work with character grade levels as well as numeric.

Changes in version: SGP_0.0-6.3

  o Fixed issue with argument calculate.sgps in studentGrowthPercentile function.

Changes in version: SGP_0.0-6.2

  o Cleaned up documentation.
  o Corrected data.table bug in studentGrowthProjections.

Changes in version: SGP_0.0-6.1

  o Fixed scoping issue with data.table implementation in studentGrowthProjections.

Changes in version: SGP_0.0-6

  o studentGrowthPercentiles and studentGrowthProjections function now produce a list with results (Knot_Boundaries, Coefficient_Matrices, Goodness_of_Fit, SGPercentiles, SGProjections) embedded.
  o studentGrowthPercentiles and studentGrowthProjections currently accept any number of panels and no longer limited to datasets of at most 8 panels.
  o studentGrowthPercentiles now accepts argument panel.data.vnames allowing user to specify a subset of variables from supplied data for analysis. 
  o studentGrowthPercentiles now accepts argument grade.progression allowing user to specify a not necessarily consecutive grade progression to perform analyses. 
  o studentGrowthPercentiles now accepts argument use.my.coefficient.matrices allowing user to specify pre-calculated coefficient matrices for student growth percentile calculation. 
  o studentGrowthPercentiles now automatically calculates maximum number of priors unless when using the grade.progression argument.
  o studentGrowthPercentiles can calculate student growth percentiles on panel data without any filtering on columns/fields.
  o studentGrowthPercentiles now defaults to providing NO percentile cuts associated with each conditional distribution. The function used to provide 1st, 35th, 65th, and 99th percentile cuts.
  o Knots_Boundaries now also includes a field for loss (lowest obtainable scale score) and hoss (highest obtainable scale score) named "loss.hoss".
  o Boundaries that are automatically calculated by the function now extend 10 percent beyond the range to better accomodate scale extension over time. Previous was 1 percent.
  o studentGrowthPercentiles now accepts boolean argument calculate.sgps controling whether function actually produces student growth percentiles (possibly just stopping after calculating coefficient matrices)
  o studentGrowthPercentiles now accepts argument knot.percentile.cuts allowing user to specify the quantile cuts used for knot calculation. Defaults to c(0.2,0.4,0.6,0.8).
  o studentGrowthPercentiles now accepts argument sgp.quantiles allowing user to specify the quantiles used for studentGrowthPercentile calculations (i.e., not always percentiles)
  o studentGrowthProjections projects out an arbitrary number of grades/years/time periods.
  o studentGrowthProjections no longer accepts argument num.panels, num.prior.scores, max.num.scores and instead uses the arguments grade.progression and max.forward.progressionand tries to internally select maximum order possible for a students percentile.growth projection/trajectory. 
  o studentGrowthProjections now accepts argument performance.level.cutscores that can utilize state assessment cutscores available within the SGP package.
  o studentGrowthProjections now accepts argument projection.unit that allows percentile growth projections/trajectories to be displayed in terms of either GRADE or YEAR.
  o Embedded goodness_of_fit plots are Grid grobs (Grid graphical objects) that can be printed as PDFs (see help for code to produce PDFs of goodness.of.fit plots). 
  o sgpData, the included longitudinal student assessment data file, has been expanded to 5 panels to better illustrate SGP functionality.
  o Includes list stateData to provide state specific information for analyses and reporting. stateData currently includes only performance level cutscores.
  o Updated help file to reflect changes in functions.

Changes in version: SGP_0.0-3

  o Included option/argument in studentGrowthPercentiles function to avoid quantile crossing based upon Dette & Volgushev (2008)
  o Cleaned up minor errors in documentation.
  o Added optional argument, convert.using.loss.hoss, to studentGrowthPercentiles to convert percentile cuts extended below/above the lowest obtainable scale score/highest obtainable 
    scale score (loss/hoss) to the loss/hoss (defaults to TRUE).

Changes in version: SGP_0.0-2

  o Updated Contributors.
  o Changed rounding of percentile cuts used for growth percentile calculation to 5 decimal places.
  o Changed rounding of automatically produced B-spline knots to 2 decimal places.
  o Extended range of automatically produced B-spline boundaries.
  o Added optional argument, percuts.digits, to studentGrowthPercentiles to allow specification of rounding digits for growth percentile cuts (defaults to 2).
  o Added optional argument, percentile.trajectories, to studentGrowthProjections allowing the function to return 1, 2, and 3 year student percentile trajectories based upon supplied percentile values 
    (defaults to 10th, 35th, 50th, 65th, and 90th). 
  o Added optional argument, projcuts.digits, to studentGrowthProjections to allow specification of rounding digits for percentile trajectory cuts (defaults to 2).
